Basics of committing:
	- git add <FILENAME>	# Yes, you have to add every file that has a change.  You can use wildcards, like 'git add *.py' and such.
	- git commit -m "<COMMIT_MESSAGE>"
	- git push origin <BRANCH_NAME>


Creating your very own personal branch:
	- git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>
	- git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>			# Creates the new branch and switches to it
	- git push origin <BRANCH_NAME>			# Pushes the new branch to the server
	- We'll chat some more when it comes time for any of us to merge back into the master branch
	

Other:
	- Use 'git checkout <branch_name>' to switch to whatever branch you want
	- Use 'git branch' to see what branch you are currently working on
	- 'git status' is a really useful command to see what files have changed and need to be added
	for committing


To get the most up to date code:
	- git pull origin <BRANCH_NAME>


If you run 'git pull' and get a merge conflict, panic!  But then calm down and we'll go over merging.
Merge conflicts suck, at least I think they do, but they can be overcome.


If you run into anything else, either google it or let me know and we can add it to this file.

Hey guys, Jackson here. Thanks to Greg for the awesome git manual! Meher, if you're looking to build
on the commands Greg provided, you might consider checking out Codeschool.com's free TryGit tutorial.
It's pretty cool and it's short. :)
