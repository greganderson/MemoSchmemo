these topics.



Why is UHC funding vital to the success of your program?

To publish this journal and make it successful we will need the help of UHC in funding 

our project. We will need to pay for advertising to get the word out about our journal, 

for both people who would like to contribute articles to our journal and for the rest of the 

community to read it. Also, if we are to do surveys or certain types of research for our 

journal that will cost money as well.
